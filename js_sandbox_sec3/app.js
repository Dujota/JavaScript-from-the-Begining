// DOM SELECTORS FOR SINGLE ELEMENTS
//DOM methods to pull things from the dom, replaced JQuery for dom manipulation and selection.

//They will allow us to grab one element by its id or class. If we use the selector to grab a class, it will select the first one in the "list" of classes that match

// document.getElementbyID()
